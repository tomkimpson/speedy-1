    "\n",
    "Modifying `geop()` fixes the bulk of the problem, but a small gap reamins, as evidenced in the plot from the previous notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    " We will refer to this gap between the 10RN solution and the 'true' solution (i.e. the 50_RN) solution as $\\delta$.\n",

    "The question is then:\n",
    " \n",
    " * Why does reduced precision cause this _systematic_ shift?\n",
    " \n",
    " * Why does stochastic rounding not suffer from the same delta?\n",

    " ---\n",
    " \n",
    " We can look at this at a high level at first. The general structure is of `SPEEDY` is:\n",
